https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=2258379#/ ??? ha. Rare idiot. He was offended that I added him to my enemies (I just pressed a minus, I always do this with fools on the Internet), then he waited 14 days until I was removed from protection, and 10 times he awarded 50,000 rewards for my head. Okay, I'm not a fool, I asked my brother to figure it out. Brother in faction
We Are Rising - they rarely understand the causes of disputes.
Personally, I have not attacked him yet. And after the brother there is nothing to attack.
